Build the python script posTagger.py with PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller
python3 -m PyInstaller --paths .\.env\Lib\site-packages\ .\posTagger_it.py

Compress the ./dist/posTagger_it.py content in a .zip file called posTagger_it.zip.
	The zip file must contain all the files directly in the root (not in the posTagger_it folder)
Add the "flag" file and the it_core_news_sm (spacy model downloaded from https://spacy.io/models/it#it_core_news_sm) to the zip archive
Move the archive to the ../POS folder
Extract the posTagger_it.exe file there and remove it from the archive
