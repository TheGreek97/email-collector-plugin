# email-collector-plugin

# Introduction 
This is an Outlook [VSTO add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/getting-started-programming-vsto-add-ins?view=vs-2022) developed in C# .NET for extracting **completely anonymous** features from emails in the user's inbox. 
These features can constitute a dataset to train Machine Learning models for email phishing detection, as they are the best features in the literature for this task.

# Requirements 
This tool is a [VSTO add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/getting-started-programming-vsto-add-ins?view=vs-2022). and, therefore, does not work on the new version of Outlook, but just on the classic Windows desktop client (as stated in Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins)).
